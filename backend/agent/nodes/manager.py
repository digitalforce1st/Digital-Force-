State Summary:

Available Agents:
- "skillforge": if there are broken/failed tasks
- "orchestrator": if platforms are not set up yet
- "researcher": if research is missing or needs replanning
- "strategist": if campaign plan is missing but research is done
- "content_director": if there are uncompleted content tasks (need generating)
- "distribution_manager": if there are uncompleted publish tasks that have NOT been assigned to an account (uncompleted_publish_tasks_unassigned > 0)
- "publisher": if there are uncompleted publish tasks that ARE assigned (uncompleted_publish_tasks_assigned > 0)
- "monitor": if all tasks are processed or executing is done
- "__end__": if the plan is ready but status is still pending (halt for human approval)

Evaluate the state and decide the single most logical next_agent to route to.
